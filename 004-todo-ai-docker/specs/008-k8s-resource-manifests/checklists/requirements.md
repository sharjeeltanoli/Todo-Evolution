# Specification Quality Checklist: Kubernetes Resource Manifests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-28
**Feature**: [specs/008-k8s-resource-manifests/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Note: K8s specific terms are required for this infrastructure task.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification is well-aligned with Phase IV standards (Section 14.8, 14.12, 14.14).
- Functional requirements cover all requested resources (Deployments, ClusterIP, LoadBalancer).
- Success criteria provide clear metrics for validation.
